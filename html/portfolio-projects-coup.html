                    to find this

                    My feeling on the way how people sell their cars can be a very painful process, the long process of
                    selling privately i.e advertising, viewing, interacting etc. Part-exchanging for less money and
                    being under pressure. Selling to third party companies could potentially be much less with
                    poor customer experience.

                    User experience could be improved a whole lot more to help users through the process of selling
                    their car. The valuation feature isn't clear and prominent on the current homepage especially on
                    mobile.

                    I also asked participants to complete different tasks of how they might go through the valuation
                    journey. Whether
                    it’s helping a family member to get a valuation of their car, a recommendation, and applying damage
                    for a more accurate valuation. These then follow up with multiple-choice questions.

                    I conducted the user interview with 5 people on the day, tagging the keywords according to
                    themes that came up often from common answers. This was to help me
                    categorise, classify and organise my data in a way that generates insights and action. See example
                    below: <br><br>

                        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Usability testing</span><br>
                        From the research gathered, it has identified the pain points many users have going through the
                        flow. Some would decide to leave after several tries in within the journey. Content and the flow
                        of the valuation journey is confusing and on mobile, has proven most difficult to use.
                        <br><br>
                        All users went to the hamburger navigation menu to start the valuation process which took some
                        time to find except for 1 user on mobile. On mobile the valuation feature is hidden behind the
                        hamburger menu, therefore, it will require users to tap twice to find it and the feature isn’t
                        visible unless you scroll down below the fold.
                        <br><br>
                        The ‘What’s my car worth?’ (valuation banner) copy isn’t clear and the banner doesn’t stand out
                        enough. From the findings, some users saw the banner but didn’t click on it because they weren’t
                        sure if it was to valuate, sell or just finding out how much your car is worth. Due to the
                        inconsistency of copy within the banner.
                        <br><br>
                        This has validated my initial assumptions of pain points users have when getting a valuation for
                        their car. The diagram below was from a workshop where the squad have been analysing the data
                        from the UX research lab, showing the progress, identifying the pain points,
                        through to research, usability testing and validations. Ready to move onto the next steps of
                        build, measure and learn.

                        By producing a design system will not only to help me but will be helpful in the future. Keeping
                        the interface consistent is absolute key to designs and for teams to work together to build the
                        ultimate product with speed and preciseness. Design systems are not only important to product
                        teams and UX teams, this also brings the development teams closer to work to the defined
                        business goals. Development teams are able to understand the logic and components to build with
                        understanding the product in the long run.

                    To generate interests and capturing curiosity, users will encounter the immediate dark theme of

                    putting a simple onboarding process with a few steps will create that fast intuitive experience for
                    users.

                    Showing relevant information about the product in a hierarchy order is key to conversion. The

                        Learning from the UX research lab sessions has guided the design decisions and empathising with
                        the customers. learning about users' needs have given me a greater head

                        Looking back on the challenges, conducting usability testing sooner on each wireframe
                        prototype to validate each section of the user experience is important to gain feedback. The
                        takeaway is understanding good conceptual models has helped me to provide appropriate
                        information to make the product understandable and enjoyable to use. In other words, good
                        communication.
