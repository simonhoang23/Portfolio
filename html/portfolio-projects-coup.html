                <p class="single__text__style__p">
                    Selling a car can be frustrating, time-consuming and hard work. On top of that, having bad UX for
                    users to valuate and leading to sell their car will make situations worst. I believe a user
                    journey from start to finish should be easy, fast and seamless for a great UX. So that users won’t
                    have to think, is the successful mission for every user flow on any website.

                <p class="single__text__style__p">
                    Currently, the Coup website displays the valuation banner poorly towards the bottom of the homepage
                    that results to users struggle to find where they can get a valuation for their car. I gathered this
                    evidence from the usability testing lab session I have conducted with my squad and from data
                    recordings. The majority of users struggled to find this feature to help them sell their car or
                    just to get a valuation.

                    My feeling on the way how people sell their cars can be a very painful process, the long process of
                    selling privately i.e advertising, viewing, interacting etc. Part-exchanging for less money and
                    being under pressure. Selling to third party companies could potentially be much less with
                    poor customer experience.

                    their car. The valuation feature isn't clear and prominent on the current homepage especially on

                    I also asked
                    participants to complete different tasks of how they might go through the valuation journey. Whether
                    it’s helping a family member to get a valuation of their car, a recommendation, and applying damage
                    for a more accurate valuation. The scenarios will follow up with multiple-choice questions.

                    of the valuation journey is confusing on mobile (according to data, 80% of the users browse the coup
                    website on mobile, therefore I have focused on the mobile first approach), has proven most difficult

                    The majority of testers have successfully completed the scenarios going through the journey, however
                    most of the testers got stuck on the last page (valuation) trying to book an appointment to sell
                    their car. Some would have gave up at that point. Learning how testers use the website has helped me
                    gained valuable insight to analyse the data.

                    This has validated my initial assumptions of pain points users have when getting a valuation for
                    their car. From the findings, the usability issues are clear. The homepage banner needed to be
                    incorporated above the fold somehow, and the focus on the valuation process is on the last page and
                    not the whole journey.

                    After analysing the data from the UX research lab, I facilitated a workshop with the squad and have
                    mapped out the diagram below showing the progress, identified the pain points from conducting the
                    user interviews and usability testing. Ready to move onto the next steps of build, measure and
