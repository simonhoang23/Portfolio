                    Coup is about driving change in how consumers are shopping for these cars online. Aiming to drive
                    further efficiencies in the market, benefitting consumers, retailers and manufacturers.

                <p class="single__text__style__p">
                    Selling a car can be frustrating, time-consuming and confusing, on top of that, websites with bad UX
                    for users to valuate and sell their car online can make situations worse. I believe a user journey
                    should be easy, fast and seamless from start to finish for a great UX, so that users won’t have to
                    think. This is the aim of every user flow on any website.

                    I aim to improve the way consumers are shopping for cars online by radically changing the UX. Coup,
                    is a leading platform for selling cars that take away the stress customers have in the purchasing
                    and selling process. Aim to drive further efficiencies in the market, benefiting consumers,
                    retailers and manufacturers.

                <p class="single__text__style__p">
                    This case study on Coup explores the value of UX, and specifically, how consumers can find where
                    they can get a valuation for their car that leads to selling their car from the homepage.

                    The way people sell their cars can be a very painful and long process. Selling privately includes
                    advertising, viewing, interacting, part-exchanging for less money and being under pressure. Selling
                    to third party companies could potentially result in lower sales with poor customer experience.

                    things/actions that customers do in order to sell their cars and to see what are the main problems
                    on the user journey. We then organised the post-it notes into themes and prioritised the processes
                    to understand what are the most important steps for customers when selling cars. For example, the
                    immediate first step is conducting research.

                    also asked participants to complete different tasks related to how they might go through the
                    valuation journey. The scenarios included helping a family member to get a valuation for their car,
                    a recommendation from a friend and applying damage for a more accurate valuation. The scenarios
                    followed up with multiple-choice questions.

                    All users went to the hamburger navigation menu to start the valuation process, which took some time
                    to find except for 1 user. On mobile, the valuation feature is hidden behind the hamburger menu (as
                    well as another banner towards the bottom of the page). Therefore, it required users to tap twice to
                    find the feature hidden behind the menu, and to scroll down the page to see the other valuation
                    feature.

                    inconsistency of copy within the banner; they weren’t sure if it was to valuate, sell or just for
                    finding out how much the car is worth.

                    of the testers got stuck on the last page (valuation) trying to book an appointment to sell their
                    car. Some would gave up at that point. Learning how testers use the website has helped me gain
                    valuable insight to analyse the data.

                    The research validated my initial assumptions of pain points users have when getting a valuation for
                    their car. From the findings, the usability issues are clear. The homepage banner needed to be
                    incorporated above the fold somehow, and the focus on the valuation process is on the last page and
                    not the whole journey.

                    After analysing the data from the UX research lab, I facilitated a workshop with the squad to
                    understand what we had learnt so far from the users. During the session, I presented the progress
                    made so far with the research and identified the pain points from conducting the user interviews and
                    usability testing. We were ready to move onto the next steps of build it, ship it and tweak it.

                    data, heatmaps, competitor analysis, current data, user tests etc), ideation, prototyping, script
                    planning, remote/lab testing, insight analysis, present ﬁndings and iteration. This then led to
                    discussions with cross functional collaboration and a launch plan for MVP.

                    etc. We wanted to find out the best ways to improve the website. With the question in mind we
                    started sketching out components that we liked from the research and annotated them for reference.

                    Printing the wireframes and sticking them on a meeting room wall, I provided the teams with dot

                        Communication is an important part of good design and no matter how amazing the product is, if
                        people can't use it then they will simply leave or stop using it. The challenge is to use
                        human-centred design to create great results and make the feature easier to find and use for a
                        more enjoyable user experience.The main objective is to make the feature searchable, successful
                        and that customers won't have to think and return back to the site.
