                <p class="single__text__style__p">
                    As a personal problem, I tend to struggle to find specific sneakers. Especially the colour, black
                    is one of the most popular colour for sneakers according to a recent study, the majority of
                    customers look for black sneakers. Second comes white and then navy.
                    <br> <br>

                    As a sneaker fan myself, I mostly purchase black ones from different brands and it is frustrating
                    that online stores either have none in stock, hard to find certain ones and having to filter out
                    other colour sneakers besides black. There must be a way to explore black
                    sneakers at your fingertips. Therefore, I am determined to find out.

                        feelings helped me empathise with them and to find solutions to the problems they have. The
                        majority of the user problems are not uncommon. In fact most parking apps have these features
                        already, I am not reinventing the wheel here but listening to customers. the user experience is
                        much greater and will make the features better and easier to use. Therefore, users won't have to
                        think.<br><br>

                        It doesn't stop there, getting the MVP of the product out there to real users will gain valuable
                        feedback and validating the assumptions as well as answering the problems customers currently
                        have. Further iterations and making the product delightful is the way forward from here.
