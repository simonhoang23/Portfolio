                    Finding a parking space can be frustrating, especially when using an app, on the go and searching

                    <br> <br>
                    According to the public on a forum, parking apps don't fulfil their needs and 35% of users drop off
                    due to frustration and difficulty in terms of using the app.

                    Tracking what users have booked or have pre-booked can be challenging to find according to the
                    customers. They said that there should be a better and more intuitive way to manage bookings to help
                    see what customers have booked, see future bookings and the history.
                    <br><br>
                    Now things are made easier with a few touches. The below screen shows the tabs at the top helps
                    users to manage their bookings much simpler and more intuitive.

                    To produce a more helpful booking navigation for the customers, is to listen to them. Customers
                    mentioned it will be very helpful that if they are able to view upcoming bookings as well as
                    currently active ones.
                    <br><br>
                    Listening to the customers, the features are now live. The booking navigation tab handles all the
                    completed, upcoming and currently active activities. Therefore, users are able to look for any
                    bookings they have made.

                    As customers said that making the product easier to use and intuitive is key for an enjoyable
                    product. The solution is that users can now manage any of the places they have saved. Tapping on the
                    ‘Add Location’ CTA will reveal the discover card screen where the user is able to swipe left or
                    right to add cities. Or tap the search bar to search manually. Much more cleaner interface to help
                    guide the CTAs.

                        One of the most mentioned pain points from the user research lab session is that customers want
                        another way to display their parking history. A more visual way where they have previously
                        booked so that they remember the best parking spaces they've used previously and can share with
                        friends and family.
                        <br><br>

                        The feature is here. The profile provides personalisation which means the timeline records every
                        parking space location the user have used around the world. As the user taps on the setting cog
                        icon, it will take them to a much more simpler, less functionality, minimal design and clear
                        CTAs. Strong user experience for easy amendments to your account settings.
                        <br><br>
                        The user can also tap on the ‘Map’ navigation tab to see the interactive map with the locations
                        they have used before, pinned on cities and towns. They are able to share with friends.

                        Listening to the customers and potential customers is vital. Learning about their thoughts and
                        feelings helped me empathise with them and to find solutions to the problems they have. The
                        majority of the user problems are not uncommon. In fact most parking apps have these features
                        already, I am not reinventing the wheel here but listening to customers. the user experience is
                        much greater and will make the features better and easier to use. Therefore, users won't have to
                        think.<br><br>

                        It doesn't stop there, getting the MVP of the product out there to real users will gain valuable
                        feedback and validating the assumptions as well as answering the problems customers currently
                        have. Further iterations and making the product delightful is the way forward from here.
